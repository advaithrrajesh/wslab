    <h2>COLLEGE CANTEEN</h2>
    <p>The student demography of CHRIST is multi-cultural and multinational. In order to cater to the variegated culinary cultures of the student population, the campuses of CHRIST are dotted with multi cuisine eateries and kiosks serving vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. There are also formal sit down dining spaces hosted by the Department of Hotel Management in the Central Campus and Hospitality facility of each campus. Hygiene, nutrition and affordability are the unique selling propositions of these eateries.</p>
